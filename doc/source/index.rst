Welcome to the Ironic Inventory Manager Integration documentation.

Introduction
============

The Inventory Manager is an open source project which aims to provide fleet
inventory management for Open Stack's Bare Metal provisioning tool Ironic.
This project is experimental and welcomes community feedback and input.

The Inventory Manager attempts to provide fleet management via a http API that
provides functionality for querying and reserving servers for provisioning.
